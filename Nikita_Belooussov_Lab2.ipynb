        "This result makes sense due to both measuring the similarities between the two phrases. The Jaccard method clearly will not produce the same value as the gold standard and most likely performces worse than it. As a result, there should be a correlation between the two results, as seen and it should be positive, which is also demonstrated. Since it would not make sense for one result to be better if the other is worse.\n",
        "<br>This code works by first tokenizing each of the sentences provide, essentially it breaks down the sentneces by the words that it contains. It will then compare the words that are located in each of the sentences to see how much they match. After this done the correlation between the two results is measured. An issue with the way this is done is that since it measuring the sets of the words and not the sentences themselves, the order does not matter. So a sentence could have a completley different word order or different meaning if it contains a different word, but this method will not catch it. As a result, this is a good way to quickly compare two different sentences to see if they have the same topics, even though the meanings of the sentences could be different."
